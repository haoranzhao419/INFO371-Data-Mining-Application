This is the final assignment in this course, so the basic goal of this team assignment is to use whatever you learned through the whole term and apply them to a dataset (a real world problem).
Our team chose one dataset about people's sentiments. Following is our throughs:
1. Load the dataset in to Jupyter Notebook and show basic information about this dataset
2. Do feature extraction (This step is really important, extract useful information and just build model upon that could save our time and get a better performation)
   * Use Spicy and NLTK these two libraries
   * Stop-words and lemmatization methods
3. Use CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer with setting one of the hyperparameters "binary" either false or true to vectorize raw data
4. Build ML models using KNN, Random Forest and MultiNaiveBayes 
5. Evaluate and visualize models' performance using precision, recall and F1-score and Matplotlib
