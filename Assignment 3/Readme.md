# The brief summary of this assignment

This assignment basically summarizes all the knowledge taught through the classes and applys them into one dataset and solve a real world problem

The algorithms and techniques I used:
* Different methods of text vectorization/text_feature_extraction (CountVectorizer, TfidfVecotrizer)
* Using KNN/Decision Tree/Random Forest/Naive Bayes to train the model
* Using Matplotlib to visualize and compare each algorithms' preformance
* Using precison/recall/F1_score to evaluate model's performance
